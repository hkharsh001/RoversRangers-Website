        <h3>What is The Scout Movement?</h3>
        <p>Scouting is a global, educational youth movement with the stated purpose of supporting young people in their physical, mental, and spiritual development so they may play constructive roles in society.

        <p>In India, the national organization is The Bharat Scouts and Guides (BSG). Formed on November 7, 1950, by merging several pioneering organizations, the BSG administers the programmes for both boys and girls. Its mission is to contribute to the education of young people through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, helping to build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.</p>
